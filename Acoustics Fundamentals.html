        <h1>Fundamentals of Acoustics: Understanding Sound and Its Behavior</h1>
    </header>
    
    <section>
        <h2>1. What is Sound?</h2>
        <p>Sound is a mechanical wave that propagates through a medium (such as air, water, or solids) due to the vibration of particles. Unlike electromagnetic waves, sound requires a medium to travel and cannot propagate in a vacuum.</p>
        <h3>Basic Properties of Sound Waves:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Frequency (f)</b>: Measured in Hertz (Hz), it represents the number of oscillations per second.</li>
            <li><b>Wavelength (λ)</b>: The distance between two successive points in a wave that are in phase.</li>
            <li><b>Speed of Sound (c)</b>: Given by \( c = f\lambda \), it depends on the medium’s properties.</li>
            <li><b>Amplitude (A)</b>: Determines the loudness of the sound wave.</li>
            <li><b>Pressure (p)</b>: The variation in pressure that the sound wave causes in the medium.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>2. Types of Sound Waves</h2>
        <h3>Based on Frequency:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Infrasonic Waves</b>: \( f < 20 \) Hz (e.g., earthquakes, elephant communication)</li>
            <li><b>Audible Waves</b>: \( 20 \) Hz to \( 20 \) kHz (human hearing range)</li>
            <li><b>Ultrasonic Waves</b>: \( f > 20 \) kHz (used in medical imaging, sonar)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>3. Wave Equation and Sound Propagation</h2>
        <p>The wave equation for sound in one dimension is:</p>
        <p>
            \[
            \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2}
            \]
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>4. Reflection, Absorption, and Transmission</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Reflection</b>: Sound bounces off surfaces (e.g., echoes).</li>
            <li><b>Absorption</b>: Some energy is absorbed by the material (important in acoustical design).</li>
            <li><b>Transmission</b>: Part of the sound passes through the medium.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>5. Doppler Effect</h2>
        <p>The <b>Doppler Effect</b> describes the change in frequency when the source or observer moves relative to each other. The observed frequency \( f' \) is given by:</p>
        <p>
            \[
            f' = f \frac{c + v_o}{c - v_s}
            \]
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>6. Applications of Acoustics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Musical Acoustics</b>: Study of how musical instruments produce sound.</li>
            <li><b>Architectural Acoustics</b>: Designing auditoriums and theaters for optimal sound quality.</li>
            <li><b>Underwater Acoustics</b>: SONAR technology for submarine navigation.</li>
            <li><b>Biomedical Acoustics</b>: Ultrasound imaging for medical diagnostics.</li>
            <li><b>Noise Control</b>: Reducing unwanted sound pollution in urban environments.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Acoustics is a fascinating field that connects physics, engineering, and human perception. Understanding sound waves and their behavior helps in designing better communication systems, musical instruments, and even medical devices. Whether in everyday life or advanced research, acoustics plays a vital role in shaping our world.</p>
